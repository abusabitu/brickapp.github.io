        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <span class="effective-date">Effective Date: October 8, 2025</span>

        <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully. By accessing or using the Brick application and technology platform (the "App" or "Service"), operated by Celar Retail Limited ("Brick," "we," "us," or "our"), you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Role and Scope of the Brick Platform</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Technology Platform and Marketplace</h3>
        <p>Brick is strictly a **technology platform** designed to facilitate access to supply opportunities by connecting Users seeking opportunities with Businesses seeking funding for inventory or trade-related purposes ("Supply Opportunities").</p>

        <h3>1.2 Not a Financial Institution</h3>
        <p class="disclaimer-box">
            <strong>CRITICAL DISCLAIMER:</strong> Brick operates strictly as a neutral technology provider. We **do not process payments, hold funds, or manage money**. We are **not** a financial institution, bank, investment advisor, broker, guarantor, or regulated financial services provider.
        </p>
        <p>Brick does not offer financial products, regulatory advice, or regulated services. The use of the platform is solely a commercial connection service.</p>

        <h2>2. Transactions, Risks, and Mediation</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Direct Transactions and Agreements</h3>
        <p>All payments, transfers, and disbursements are made **directly by the User to the Business** using banking details provided within the platform. Any agreement on funding terms, expected returns, or repayment schedules is **exclusively between the User and the Business**. Brick is not a party to these underlying agreements.</p>

        <h3>2.2 No Financial Guarantee</h3>
        <p>Brick explicitly **does not guarantee, warrant, or insure** any expected return, repayment of principal, or profit from any Supply Opportunity. Users acknowledge that participating in Supply Opportunities involves significant commercial risk, including the potential for partial or total loss of funds.</p>
        
        <h3>2.3 User Risk</h3>
        <p>All activity facilitated through the App is conducted at the **discretion and sole risk** of the User. Brick is not responsible for the Business's operational performance, solvency, or its ability to meet repayment obligations.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Commitment to Dispute Mediation (The Key Clause)</h3>
        <p>To foster trust and stability within our marketplace, Brick implements a dispute resolution mechanism. **While Brick does not act as a financial guarantor, we commit to using our best efforts to facilitate and mediate repayment disputes** in cases where a Business fails to provide repayment to the User as per their direct agreement.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Mediation Service:** We will actively engage with both parties to seek an amicable and timely resolution, aiming to maximize the likelihood that backers receive their money as at when due.</li>
            <li>**Non-Financial Liability:** Our obligation is limited to providing the mediation service itself. **This mediation commitment does not constitute a financial guarantee or warranty of repayment by Brick.** Failure of the mediation process to secure repayment does not create any financial liability for Brick.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Limitation of Liability and Indemnity</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BRICK SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR FUNDS, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ARISING FROM:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any Business's failure to repay funds or meet its obligations.</li>
            <li>The outcome or failure of the dispute **mediation process** described in Section 2.4.</li>
            <li>Your reliance on information provided by any Business.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Indemnification</h3>
        <p>You agree to defend and indemnify Brick, its employees, and affiliates from all claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including attorney's fees) arising out of your **(a)** use of the App, **(b)** violation of these Terms, or **(c)** any dispute, agreement, or loss resulting from a transaction entered into with a Business.</p>

        <h2>4. General Provisions</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Nigeria. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within that jurisdiction to resolve any legal matter arising from these Terms.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Changes to Terms</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of material revisions (typically 30 days) prior to them becoming effective. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
